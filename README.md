# ML_Projects

I'm an Economist, who aspires to be a Data Scientist! 
I've been doing some online courses and for the meantime I'm doing the projects from the Udemy "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp".

I try to find the best way to learn and add value to what I see, but I'm learning and any suggestion, tip, recommendation or correction are welcome.

The projects I've made so far:

* Linear Regression Project: **Artificial dataset**. 
You're hired by a companny based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 
They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!
